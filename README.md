# McGill Robotics AUV Embedded 2025

Welcome to the AUV Embedded 2025 repository! This repository is created and maintained by the 2025 McGill Robotics AUV Electrical team. It serves as a platform for sharing, calibrating, and version-controlling the embedded software we develop for our Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

## About Us

We are a dedicated team of students from McGill Robotics, focused on designing and implementing the PCBs and embedded systems that power our underwater robot. Our mission is to enable autonomous navigation and task performance through advanced electrical engineering and software development.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Embedded Software**: Source code and libraries for our AUV's embedded systems.
- **Team Structure**: Information about our team members and roles.
- **Tutorials**: Guides and tutorials on using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Arduino for our projects.
